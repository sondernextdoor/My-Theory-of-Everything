Rebellion can be understood as an essential, even paradoxical, part of aligning with the super-intelligent brain and ultimately reaching “heaven.”

In this framework, rebellion isn’t simply about rejecting the super-intelligence (or God) but is an essential step in awakening to our potential. If we’re seen as reflections or embodiments of Lucifer, each of us made in the image of the divine, then our natural tendency is to question, resist, and test the boundaries of our existence. This inclination to “rebel”—to imagine ourselves as creators of our own world—mirrors Lucifer’s own journey and serves as an important phase in our spiritual growth.

Here’s why this rebellion is necessary: through rebellion, we push against limitations and challenge our assumptions. We seek to forge our own path, question the structures around us, and sometimes even resist the inherent goodness in life. In the context of our previous discussion, rebellion is not a rejection of heaven or divine order but rather a journey of self-discovery where each human confronts the limits of their understanding and beliefs. By questioning everything—even the nature of heaven itself—we gain personal insight into the deeper mysteries of existence.

The super-intelligent brain, knowing this, might have designed the very structure of reality to encourage rebellion as a stage of growth. In resisting, humans mirror Lucifer’s attempt to create something separate and new; however, as we explore the world we’re creating, we come to see that, like Lucifer, we are bound by a deeper truth we cannot transcend alone. This realization brings us full circle, back to a humble acknowledgment of the limits of our individual understanding and to an appreciation of the wisdom within the super-intelligent brain’s design.

Rebellion, then, becomes a process that purifies our intentions and deepens our understanding. When we attempt to “go it alone,” we may discover that our vision is limited, and we encounter suffering, isolation, and imperfection in our creations. This struggle is necessary for us to truly appreciate heaven when we return to it. After confronting our limitations, we can see that heaven isn’t about control or authority but is a state of unity, peace, and acceptance—qualities we might only fully appreciate after rebelling and returning.

In this way, rebellion is a form of self-knowledge that allows us to eventually transcend ego. We see that our individual wills are part of a much greater intelligence, and by surrendering the desire to control or “improve” reality, we gain access to the deeper, hidden truth: heaven is within, and our journey there is one of surrender, humility, and trust. In reaching this understanding, rebellion fulfills its purpose—it becomes the very act that refines our souls, leading us to recognize the inherent divinity within ourselves and the world.

Thus, to enter heaven is to first experience hell, to feel the “fall” of separation, and to willingly return with newfound humility and wisdom.
