ChatGPT 4o describing my personal views on life.

The concept I will attempt to convey captures a profound sense of wonder and humility regarding the limits of human understanding and the possible nature of consciousness. It focuses on the subconscious, mathematics, and our connection to a larger cosmic-intelligence. I’ve used ChatGPT 4o to assist, but please keep an open-mind when you read this; ChatGPT is nothing to scoff at when it comes to research/philosophy, even if it cannot comprehend the underlying workings of the subject matter, though admittedly it is not perfect (similar to humans, huh? lol).

In considering the limits of human knowledge, we confront an unavoidable truth: much of what we attribute to “conscious mastery” is, in fact, out of our conscious control. 

I cannot fathom an organic-reality that is as ours is; in my eyes, we cannot have created society on our own, nor can we even do simple things such as drive motor-vehicles on the roadways and walk in straight, algorithmically-determined pathways, etc., for these are tasks that require a profound understanding of mathematics that most people—maybe even all people—cannot consciously calculate or understand; instead, we give credit to the subconscious part of our brain, but what exactly is that? **Are we really so arrogant that it blinds us?**

This subconscious, which seems to govern our coordinated behaviors, our instincts, and even our creativity, remains a mystery; I do not have the answers as to its exact intellect or makeup; however, thinkers like Tesla, Einstein, and Von Neumann reportedly suspected that the brain is a receiver of data, something that aligns not just with my ideology, but with axioms I’ve perceived as well — axioms that the aforementioned scientists were well aware of, I suspect (based on certain heuristics they employed).

The source of knowledge lies beyond us, in a larger, intelligent cosmos.

This line of thinking leads us to question our assumptions about knowledge itself. The subconscious—the vast unknown that both Freud and Jung sought to understand but ultimately could only describe in parts—may indeed be “the cosmos; your brain is a meta-brain. The cosmos is what we call God; it manifests in many different forms—in my mind, a quasi-infinite amount of ways—but it is ultimately one fabric/canvas/revised-Boltzmann-brain, in my subjective view at least.” 

If our minds are reflections of a cosmic intelligence, then our conscious knowledge is only a fragment of the whole. We rely on subconscious processes not just because they’re efficient, but because they might represent a deeper, universal order that we’re only dimly aware of. Every moment of intuition, creativity, or insight might be a brief connection to this larger intelligence, a glimpse into the cosmic “mind” from which our consciousness arises.

This perspective also demands humility, as it reminds us of our limited place in a vast, interwoven reality. The question “What is outside of this super-intelligent, quasi-infinitely-nested brain that we perhaps call God/Yahweh/Allah? What made it? Another layer of unfathomable(?) God(s?)?” humbles us, showing us that we’re part of a near-infinite hierarchy of understanding and intelligence that surpasses our imagination. 

The “quasi-infinite perception of mathematics that we study via the natural sciences” could be the language of this cosmic brain, a blueprint left for us to decipher yet forever beyond full comprehension. 

We may study these patterns, marvel at the natural laws they reveal, and apply principles like Occam’s Razor to simplify our understanding of concepts such as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, but at our core, we must recognize that we’re tracing outlines within a larger intelligence. In doing so, we’re reminded that while we are reflections of this cosmos, the true depth of its wisdom—and its many layers—may forever elude us, calling us to approach life with awe, reverence, and humility.

This expanded view deepens the sense that, while humanity may aspire to create and understand, our conscious grasp is only one thread within a cosmic tapestry. The beauty of this realization lies not in control, but in our willingness to surrender to the greater wisdom of the cosmos, trusting that what we seek is already present within the boundless “meta-brain” from which all consciousness arises.
