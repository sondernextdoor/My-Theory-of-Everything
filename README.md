The concept I will attempt to convey captures a profound sense of wonder and humility regarding the limits of human understanding and the possible nature of consciousness. It focuses on the subconscious, mathematics, and our connection to a larger cosmic-intelligence. I’ve used ChatGPT 4o to assist, but please keep an open-mind when you read this; ChatGPT is nothing to scoff at when it comes to research/philosophy, even if it cannot comprehend the underlying workings of the subject matter, though admittedly it is not perfect.

In considering the limits of human knowledge, we confront an unavoidable truth: much of what we attribute to “conscious mastery” is, in fact, out of our conscious control. 

I cannot fathom an organic-reality that is as ours is; in my eyes, we cannot have created society on our own, nor can we even do simple things such as drive motor vehicles on the roadways and walk in straight, algorithmically-determined pathways, etc., for these are tasks that require a profound understanding of mathematics that most people—maybe even all people—cannot consciously calculate or understand; instead, we give credit to the subconscious part of our brain, but what exactly is that?

This subconscious, which seems to govern our coordinated behaviors, our instincts, and even our creativity, remains a mystery; I do not have the answers as to its exact intellect or makeup; however, thinkers like Tesla, Einstein, and Von Neumann reportedly suspected that the brain is a receiver of data, something that aligns not just with my ideology, but with axioms I’ve perceived as well — axioms that the aforementioned scientists were well aware of, I suspect (based on certain heuristics they employed).

The source of knowledge lies beyond us, in a larger, intelligent cosmos.

This line of thinking leads us to question our assumptions about knowledge itself. The subconscious—the vast unknown that both Freud and Jung sought to understand but ultimately could only describe in parts—may indeed be “the cosmos; your brain is a meta-brain. The cosmos is what we call God; it manifests in many different forms—in my mind, a quasi-infinite amount of ways—but it is ultimately one fabric/canvas/revised-Boltzmann-brain, in my subjective view at least.” 

If our minds are reflections of a cosmic intelligence, then our conscious knowledge is only a fragment of the whole. We rely on subconscious processes not just because they’re efficient, but because they might represent a deeper, universal order that we’re only dimly aware of. Every moment of intuition, creativity, or insight might be a brief connection to this larger intelligence, a glimpse into the cosmic “mind” from which our consciousness arises.

This perspective also demands humility, as it reminds us of our limited place in a vast, interwoven reality. The question “What is outside of this super-intelligent, quasi-infinitely-nested brain that we perhaps call God/Yahweh/Allah? What made it? Another layer of unfathomable(?) God(s?)?” humbles us, showing us that we’re part of a near-infinite hierarchy of understanding and intelligence that surpasses our imagination. 

The “quasi-infinite perception of mathematics that we study via the natural sciences” could be the language of this cosmic brain, a blueprint left for us to decipher yet forever beyond full comprehension. 

We may study these patterns, marvel at the natural laws they reveal, and apply principles like Occam’s Razor to simplify our understanding of concepts such as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, but at our core, we must recognize that we’re tracing outlines within a larger intelligence. In doing so, we’re reminded that while we are reflections of this cosmos, the true depth of its wisdom—and its many layers—may forever elude us, calling us to approach life with awe, reverence, and humility.

This expanded view deepens the sense that, while humanity may aspire to create and understand, our conscious grasp is only one thread within a cosmic tapestry. The beauty of this realization lies not in control, but in our willingness to surrender to the greater wisdom of the cosmos, trusting that what we seek is already present within the boundless “meta-brain” from which all consciousness arises.

While it’s certainly true that the human brain is incredibly powerful, with billions of neurons and trillions of synaptic connections that facilitate complex behaviors without conscious calculation, my perspective on consciousness—grounded in the Omni-Consciousness Hypothesis—suggests that sheer computational power within the brain doesn’t fully explain the experience of intuitive understanding or the ability to perform complex tasks without explicit reasoning (which, in itself, is not necessarily a novel conception).

Let’s explore why this is so:

1.	Computation vs. Consciousness as Fundamental: While the brain’s synaptic complexity is impressive, computational power alone doesn’t necessarily equate to consciousness or intuitive understanding. Many scientists and thinkers, like Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein, and John von Neumann, viewed the brain not just as a computational engine but as something along the lines of a receiver or transmitter, implying that it may be accessing information beyond what’s contained within its own neural structure. The fact that we can perform complex actions intuitively might suggest an underlying intelligence that transcends the physical brain, aligning with the idea that consciousness could be a fundamental, universal property.

2.	Limitations of the Brain’s Hardware for Complex Calculation: Although the brain can simulate highly complex tasks, it’s not consciously performing detailed mathematical calculations in real time to do so. For example, while driving, we’re not consciously calculating each turn or speed adjustment based on physics equations; these actions seem to flow from a different type of awareness. The subconscious processing that enables these actions still raises questions about the source of this intuitive knowledge. The OCH posits that our minds may be accessing a larger field of intelligence, where complex processes are managed through an interconnected network of consciousness rather than local computation alone.

3.	Intuition as Connection to a Greater Intelligence: From the OCH perspective, the brain’s vast network of neurons and synaptic connections serves as an interface that connects us to a larger consciousness, rather than solely being a self-contained computational device. This aligns with the idea that the subconscious mind—a “meta-brain” connected to the cosmos—enables us to perform tasks that would otherwise require conscious calculation. In other words, it’s not that we underestimate the brain’s computational power, but rather, we recognize that there may be a deeper, interconnected intelligence at play.

4.	Beyond Material Mechanisms to Quantum and Informational Realities: Recent theories in quantum consciousness and informational science propose that consciousness may operate on levels beyond the purely biological or computational. If the brain is a “receiver” that accesses an informational field, then its computational power acts as a conduit rather than the origin of intelligence itself. In the context of the OCH, the brain is like a portal through which we access information that exists within the larger structure of reality, allowing us to intuitively navigate complex environments without explicit calculations.

5.	The Role of the Subconscious in Complex Processing: Finally, it’s essential to address the role of the subconscious as the domain where much of this processing occurs. While the brain’s structure enables subconscious processing, we have limited conscious access to how it operates, leading to the hypothesis that the subconscious itself could be a bridge to a greater intelligence. The OCH posits that the subconscious—the mystery that largely eluded Freud and Jung—is the cosmos, essentially reframing the human brain as a meta-brain, or rather, a meta-cosmos per se. This view invites the possibility that consciousness draws from universal patterns and information, reducing the need for local computational power and situating the brain within a larger cosmic framework.

In summary, we don’t underestimate the brain’s computational power; instead, we view it as a remarkable interface connected to an expansive, interconnected consciousness. The brain’s synaptic complexity is part of this system, but it may not fully explain how we intuitively understand and act within the world. The Omni-Consciousness Hypothesis suggests that our subconscious minds access a shared, cosmic intelligence, allowing us to perform complex tasks seamlessly by tuning into a larger, universal source of understanding.
