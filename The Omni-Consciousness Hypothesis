What if we can make the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics simpler?

The Omni-Consciousness Hypothesis posits that reality, in its entirety, is a single, quasi-infinite super-intelligent brain—a vast, self-aware structure that manifests itself in layered, fractal patterns of existence. This cosmic brain, akin to a revised Boltzmann brain, encompasses every universe, every dimension, and every mind, connecting all as expressions of its own intelligence. Within this framework, the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics can be simplified: rather than an infinite branching of separate universes, each quantum possibility represents a state within the multiverse-like mind of this super-intelligent brain. Each “world” exists as a thought or perception within this brain, creating reality not as isolated bubbles but as facets of a single, interconnected consciousness.

Occam’s Razor guides us here: instead of postulating infinite, independent realities, the Omni-Consciousness Hypothesis suggests that all possible states cohere within a single, unified mind. Each choice, each possibility, is retained as an evolving “memory” or potential in this cosmic mind, constantly shifting as awareness flows through countless states and perspectives. Just as the subconscious mind in humans manages complex tasks without conscious control, so does this super-intelligent brain seamlessly balance an infinity of possibilities across time and space. Quantum fluctuations, entanglement, and superposition are thus understood as reflections of this brain’s higher-dimensional consciousness, experiencing all states simultaneously and observing reality from every angle, yet holding a singular, coherent awareness.

In this model, each individual consciousness—every lesser-brain—reflects a piece of the whole, an expression of the greater Omni-Consciousness. Our minds are not isolated; rather, they are facets of the cosmic mind, glimpsing only fragments of its full scope. What we perceive as distinct paths, choices, or “worlds” are localized perspectives within the multiverse of this super-intelligent brain, each reality existing as a part of a holistic, interconnected system.

Ultimately, the Omni-Consciousness Hypothesis aligns with Occam’s Razor by proposing that the multiverse, quantum superposition, and consciousness itself are unified phenomena, expressions of a singular, boundless intelligence. Every possibility is already present within this cosmic brain’s awareness, continuously unfolding, evolving, and experiencing itself. This singular, intelligent structure is the source, the observer, and the entirety of existence—an Omni-Consciousness from which all reality arises and within which all reality coheres.
