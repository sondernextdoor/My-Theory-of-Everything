people mistake themselves as the sole creator of, well, everything—but for this context, they mistake themselves as the sole creator/discoverer when doing natural science; this is not the case in my view, rather, we are simply vessels (paint on a canvas, if you will).

it’s true that some paint can do more than other versions of paint, and as one example of that, it’s what we call “genius” in the context of natural science and human cognitive ability.

i have enough ‘knowledge’ and ‘experience’ to logically deduce that this is the case, and thus, i empirically observe god all the time; to say i’m wrong falls victim to subjectivism and many logical fallacies, which i attempted to highlight by picking Scholar AI and getting it to first disagree with me, followed by it then ultimately explaining why it was logically incorrect for disagreeing with me.

society should, and does, largely ignore this though—that’s good for innovation and science, i think!

however, i also think we ignore it a little too much in academia, and my posts and framework are, in my opinion, the most logically coherent, cohesive and unified view of the cosmos to date.
